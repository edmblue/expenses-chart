This was a real surprise cause at first sight it looks like a really easy project where you have to use some library to make the chart and that's all. But I was wrong! haha, when I started to see all the details on the colors, hover status, background colors, toolstips I had to play and find out about all the properties and config that this library have just to have the exact result of this challenge

At the end I learned a lot and it was really fun to make!😁
